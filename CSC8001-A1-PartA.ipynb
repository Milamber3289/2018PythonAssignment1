    "Let's play a round of Literary Scrabble: a game of Scrabble where you can only play words that appear in selected literary classics.  The functions you will write for Part A will let you answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many unique words does Mark Twain's book the <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> have?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the highest scoring word from Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> that you can play with the letters 'qazvredl'?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which books have the most words which use the letters `j` and `x`?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Part A complete each of the Word Analysis and Word Questions functions below.  The Word Analysis functions will provide the primary text analysis to help you answer the questions defined in this notebook. The code you write for each Word Question's function will need to call the appropriate Word Analysis function(s) and then complete any additional processing necessary to answer the specific question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Answers to the specific questions above have been provided for you so that you can test your code.  \n",
